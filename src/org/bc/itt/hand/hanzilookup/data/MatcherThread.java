 * MatcherThread is Thread for running character match comparisons via
 * its given StrokesMatcher.  It reports its results to the given
 * ResultsHandler.  This used to be tied together with the StrokesMatcher
 * implementation, but tying the Thread functionality to the comparison
 * computation was suboptimal.
 * 
 * This is written with the expectation that only one comparsion
 * need by done at any given time, and that it's more efficient
 * to use the same Thread instance rather than allocating a new
 * Thread all the time.  So you instantiate one of these and start it up.
 * After which you instruct it to run comparisons by invoking the
 * setStrokeMatcher method.  When it's done, it will go to sleep
 * waiting for the next comparison.  Since it's always alive,
 * you probably want to run this Thread as a daemon.
